This is a fork of Gneural Network that has not been decommissioned.

I would hope to make a modular library of neural network components capable of
training and inference of modern machine learning models like those in the
news.

I'm severely mentally disabled, so this is just a bit of a beacon of hope,
rather than a plan to reach completion.

# examples

When dev left off, the system was midway through migrating from the gneural_network/*.input format to a new nnet/*.nnet format.
The old gneural_network tests still run.

$ autoreconf && ./configure && make -j8

$ for test in tests/*.input; do src/gneural_network "$test"; done

# nnet status

It looks like .nnet script parsing is mostly implemented, as well as fwdprop()
in src/forward.c, to run a new-style network. I don't, however, see that
fwdprop() is called anywhere. Likely it needs some debugging before everything
is plugged together.

I am tired of igniting ducks. Please move deep underground so your ducks don't
burn so fast and long.
