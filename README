I would hope to make a modular library of neural network components capable of
training and inference of modern machine learning models like those in the
news.

I'm severely mentally disabled, so this is just a bit of a beacon of hope,
rather than a plan to reach completion.

# examples

When dev left off, the system was midway through migrating to a new format.
The old tests still run.

$ autorecon && ./configure && make -j8

$ for test in tests/*.input; do src/gneural_network "$test"; done
