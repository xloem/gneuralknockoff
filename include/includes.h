// This is supposed to prevent us from having to parse a whole bunch of library header files more than once.  unfortunately macros and typedefs from included
// headers are not included transitively, so for many definitions it doesn't work.  Could be fixed by echoing important typedefs and macro defns here, but we're
// nowhere near the knee of the curve where parsing recursive includes starts to occupy 90+% of the compile time.  Unless this gets to be a
// ten-million-line-plus program, headers including headers ad infinitum is not likely to occupy more than half our compile time and 'extra' includes for macros
// & typedefs shouldn't be a problem. The usual suspects for redundant parsing are stdint (uint32_t & friends) and stdio (FILE, size_t, etc).
